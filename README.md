 2. Once successfully installed, navigate to the download location, and run 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies.
 3. Once dependencies installed, 'npm start' should start the development sever.
 4. Download the 'Expo' app from the App Store.
 5. Scan the QR code (from the development server) with your camera to load the RoomFinder app within the 'Expo' app.

## Connecting to the Server

 1. Follow the README instructions within the Server folder.
 2. Once running, the server should display an IP address in terminal.
 3. Press the Set IP button at the top right of the RoomFinder app, and enter the provided IP address.
 4. Assuming your phone and computer are connected to the network correctly, you will be able to navigate the RoomFinder app and view all the data.
